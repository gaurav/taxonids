TaxonIds
Copyright (C) Gaurav Vaidya, 2011.

This website provides a lookup service for Wikipedia editors who
want to quickly add a `Template:TaxonIds`[1] template to a taxonomic
article on Wikipedia. Given a species number, it will look up several
species databases and look up the taxon ids on them. Finally, it
will format these as a valid `Template:TaxonIds` string and provide
it to the user for direct insertion into the Wikipedia article.
