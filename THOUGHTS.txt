What are we tracking?

 A Species: (Name --> Types @ Publication)

 - Process:
  1. Specimens collected, vouchered.
  2. Publication defining types, name. (name created)
  3. Publication identifying museum specimens/observations.

 - Names
  - Linking to names ("superseded by", "belongs to").
  - Linking to specimens ("holotype", "lectotype", "identified as")
  - Linking to publications ("defined in", "sensu", "information about", "used by")

 - Publications
  - Including page information/link to scan/taxon definition.

 - Specimens
  - In museums or as GBIF observations.

Simplest total linkup we can do right now: GBIF obs <-> BHL pub <-> ITIS name.

What's the selling point? 
Why would anybody want data to be linked up in this way? 
 - So that all information about "Panthera tigris" can be collected together in some way.

Why is the original publication important/interesting to non-taxonomists at all?
 - Without a "sensu" or a definition, a name is potentially meaningless: "Panthera tigris" could mean different things to everybody who uses that term, whereas "Panthera tigris L." is relatively unambiguous, at least in terms of definition. However:
    (1) not everybody is that fussy about names, especially in ecology -- a tiger is a tiger, because it's unlikely to be mistaken for a near-conspecific.
    (2) even where errors are likely (insects, for e.g.), ... 
    (3) the only reason this is an issue at all is (a) inadvertent errors inside large groups, which are unlikely, and (b) cross-code or cross-group synonymies, in which case the full name might be used to 

What is important:
 - name (binomial, monomial)
 - authority
  - or is it?
 - a standard representation (i.e. iPlant TNRS)
  - but if the taxonomic community can guarantee perfectly disambiguated binomials and monomials, we don't need anything apart from the Linnaean name.
   - but we will still need "old" (non-disambiguated) Linnaean names so that pre-disambiguated b/mials make sense.
 - status (in use? deprecated in favour of ...?)
 - again, if the tax. comm. can g. p. d. b/mials, we're good to go.
